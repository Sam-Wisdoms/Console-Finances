# Title: Console-Finances

## A code for analysing the financial records of a company
This project is an analysis of the financial records of a company for 86 months.
The project have analyzed the following parameters based on the financial records presented by the company:

1. An analysis of the total number of months that was included in the dataset.
2. An analysis of the net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.
3. An analysis of the average of the **changes** in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
4. An analysis of the greatest increase in Profit/Losses (date and amount) over the entire period.
5. An analysis of the greatest decrease in Profit/Losses (date and amount) over the entire period.
The Tools that were used to analyse the financial date of the company are JavaScript and HTML.
The challenges that were faced in analyzing the data has to do with the technicalities that were involved with 
the use of the JavaScript language. However, I have managed to overcome them through research and collaboration.
The analysed data have been deployed on GitHub and the analysis can be accessed by going to the console so I will 
encourage anyone who have visited my page to have a look at this project.
In case you have any difficulty accessing the console, please feel free to email me via 
## sampson.aglanu@gmail.com or asamwisdoms@gmail.com and 
I will be glad to help you access the analysis.
